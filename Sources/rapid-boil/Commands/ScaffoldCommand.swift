        rapid-boil is an opinionated library, and as such it makes certain assumptions about the configuration of your application. Below is a list of basic terms in relation to the opinions of the tools. For a more complete explanation, run `rapid-boil manual`.
        
        NOTE: If you have not run `rapid-boil initiate`, you should be passing the --basic flag. Otherwise, your code will not compile.
        
        Model: The resource that represents a table in your database
        Migration: For this command, the initial migration related to the created Model
        [X]Representable: Data can be represented differently within the API and the Web versions, these helper methods return Codable content
        Controllers: Since Web and API representable are different, we also supply two different controllers
        AutoMigrate: A custom class that can be added to your Vapor application that allows for automatically adding all Migrations, use this flag to use that class instead of Migration.
        Views: Basic Show, Index, and Form views to interact with your Model. Not generated if api-only flag is passed.
        Basic: Scaffolding that gives a simple CRUD Controller, along with a Model, Migration, and Views
